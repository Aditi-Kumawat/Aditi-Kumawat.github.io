    <p>
        This research is a key component of the collaborative <a href="https://geothermie-allianz.de/en/home/" target="_blank">Geothermie-Allianz Bayern</a> initiative, aimed at harnessing deep geothermal energy in Bavaria, Germany.
    <p>
        The Bavarian Molasse Basin provides ideal conditions for geothermal energy, but geothermal operations as shown in Figure 1, particularly during subsurface water injection, can induce micro-seismic events that cause building vibrations. Although these vibrations are usually harmless, they have led to public concern due to their annoyance and, in rare cases, panic from stronger events. This project seeks to better understand these impacts to enhance public support and mitigate risks.

        The project deals with the analysis of groud motion data as well as the vibrational analysis of the urban structures. A recent study {% cite taddei2024development %} in this direction examines small earthquakes caused by geothermal power plants in Southern Germany and develops new equations to predict ground motion during these events. The research uses data from a power plant in Insheim, Germany and combines it with simulated data for the Munich area. The findings highlight the need for region-specific ground motion prediction equations.

        Another study by {% cite kumawat2024impact %} also tests the impact of the events on low-rise building, showing that while minor earthquakes meet serviceability and comfort standards, slightly stronger ones do not. These insights help improve risk assessments and safety planning for geothermal energy projects. The methodology used in this study combines two modeling techniques, finite element and lumped parameter models, to assess how buildings respond to vibrations caused by geothermal earthquakes. The building taxonomy considered in this approach focuses on how factors like building geometry, structural stiffness, material properties, damping, and soil type affect the model's performance. These factors were chosen based on past studies analyzing how residential buildings respond to vibrations from railways. This approach offers a new way to understand how physical variations impact building behavior during small seismic events.
