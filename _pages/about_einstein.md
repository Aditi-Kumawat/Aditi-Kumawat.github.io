I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Chair of Structural Mechanics, Technical University of Munich, where I have been working since 2021. My PhD focused on advancing the modeling and simulation of railway infrastructure, with a particular emphasis on improving the accuracy and efficiency of computational methods.

Before joining the Technical University of Munich, I worked as a guest scientist at the Institute of Railways and Transportation at the University of Stuttgart from June to December 2019. I also served as a visiting researcher at the Chair of Structural Mechanics at the Technical University of Munich from February 2020 to August 2021.

My research expertise encompasses computational modeling of railway track systems, wave propagation in elastic media, soil-structure interactions, and structural vibrations in residential buildings. Through my background in research and teaching, I have a fundamental understanding of mechanics, signal processing, structural dynamics, and wave propagation.

I am actively seeking professional roles in computational modeling and vibration analysis of structural systems, where I can apply and further develop my skills.
