I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Chair of Structural Mechanics, Technical University of Munich, where I have been working since 2021. I completed my PhD at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, focusing the modeling and simulation of railway infrastructure, particularly in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of analytical approaches. 

Before joining the Technical University of Munich, I worked as a guest scientist at the Institute of Railways and Transportation at the University of Stuttgart from June to December 2019. I also served as a visiting researcher at the Chair of Structural Mechanics at the Technical University of Munich from February 2020 to August 2021.

My research areas include the analytical and numerical modeling of railway track systems, wave propagation in elastic media, soil-structure interactions, and structural vibrations in residential buildings. My background in research and teaching has provided me with a solid understanding of mechanics, signal processing, structural dynamics, and wave propagation.
